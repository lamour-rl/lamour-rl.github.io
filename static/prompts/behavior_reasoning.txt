Identify the specific physical behavior that an agent should execute to recover from an out-of-distribution (OOD) state and return to a state where it can effectively perform its original task.

The original task and the agent's OOD state are defined as follows:
- Original Task Description: {original_task}  
- OOD State Description in {env_name}: {ood_description}  

Based on the descriptions of the OOD state and the original task, determine the single recovery behavior by following these steps:
1. Identify the state in which the agent can successfully perform the original task.
2. Determine the single specific behavior required to transition the agent from the OOD state to the state where it can successfully perform the original task.

Avoid including unnecessary details that do not directly contribute to the recovery process.

Follow these guidelines when formulating the recovery behavior:
1. Do not reference the original task directly in the recovery behavior.
2. Provide a single, clear, and concise sentence that describes the single recovery behavior the agent should execute.
   
The output format should be: [A single, concise sentence explaining the single recovery behavior]
